## Overview

My research focuses on high-energy nuclear physics, studying the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and collective phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. Particularly, I am interested in:

* Spin physics
* Equilibrium with rotation and acceleration
* Anomalous transport
* Simulations of field theories with tensor networks and exact diagonalization

## Current interests
![SPINNERET](/assets/images/spinneret.png)

I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action fellowship with my project <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101198140">SPINNERET</a> - spin polarization in non equilibrated relativistic plasmas.  

I have three main research objectives (ROs):  

* 1 - **Fixing of the spin tensor in non-equilibrium relativistic statistical mechanics**:
  In the out-of-equilibrium QGP, we are faced with the pseudogauge ambiguity, which is the freedom to redefine the
orbital angular momentum and the spin tensor densities such that the total (integrated) angular momentum is left
invariant. This freedom, however, affects theretical predictions. My research addresses this problem.

* 2 - **Shear-induced polarization and related effects**:
The description of polarization in high energy heavy ion collisions relies on the local
equilibration of the QGP, and the effect known as shear induced polarization is
of capital importance. However, it has never been studied in a non-perturbative approach, and the effect of non-dissipative thermal shear on other observables is still to be investigated.

* 3 - **Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for relativistic equilibria**:
I got interested in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which allowsto describe thermalization of an isolated quantum system. I want to extend this approach to relativistic equilibria, in particular to the case of equilibrium with acceleration.
