      alt: "PRD"
      title: "Thermalization from quantum entanglement: jet simulations in the massive Schwinger model"
      url: "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/sgrx-jpp9"
      excerpt: "We simulate the Schwinger model coupled with external sources on a 1+1D lattice, and observe an emerging thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour."

      alt: "PRL"
      title: "Emergent Canonical Spin Tensor in the Chiral-Symmetric Hot QCD "
      url: "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.262301"
      excerpt: "We show that certain type of interactions can be viewed, in a statistical way, as an emergent spin tensor."

paper3:

      alt: "EPJ C"
      title: "Λ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the quark–gluon plasma formation and properties"
      url: "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-13229-z"
      excerpt: "We use state of the art hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how transport properties can impact the polarization of the Λ hyperon."
      
paper4:

      alt: "EPJ Plus"
      title: "Exact spin polarization of massive and massless particles in relativistic fluids at global equilibrium"
      url: "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-04169-w"
      excerpt: "Using the analytic continuation of the global equilibrium density operator, we compute the exact spin polarization vector and spin density matrix for particles of arbitrary mass and spin."
